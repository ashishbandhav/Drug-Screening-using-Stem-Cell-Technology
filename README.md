# Drug Screening Using Stem Cell Technology

### 🧠 Overview
This repository contains the implementation and research findings of **"Drug Screening Using Stem Cell Technology"**, authored by **Bandhakavi Sai Ashish** and collaborators from **Lovely Professional University** and **Guru Nanak Institutions Technical Campus**.

This work integrates **machine learning (ML)** with **stem cell biology** to enhance the precision and efficiency of **drug discovery and toxicity prediction**. By using **hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes**, we built a robust drug screening framework that surpasses traditional 2D and animal models in predictive accuracy.

### 📊 Features
- Utilizes **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Random Forest**, and **CNN** models.
- Performs **toxic vs. non-toxic drug response classification**.
- Analyzes **microscopic cellular images** for phenotype recognition.
- Implements **data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model validation**.
- Achieves over **90% prediction accuracy** on benchmark datasets.
